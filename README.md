# FinalProject

## Progress
This 3rd commit provides the most recent project proposal, semi-ready data files and a mockup of
how the machine learning analysis will be conducted, using a combination of real and psuedo-
coding.
- Final proposal version 3 is the latest
- ERD was done first in LucidChart, then made into a .png file
- A more detailed ERD will be done in quickdatbasediagrams.com
- Data will be stored in PostGres for future use
- Data is in the Resources subfolder
- Literature supporting my study is in Review_literature
- Sql statements are in SQL statements folder (not Postgres, but those needed to extract data from our EMR)
