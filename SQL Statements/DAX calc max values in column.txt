Sample code used to ensure ranked by date for multiple diagnoses


THIS FILE SHOWS THE DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS USED IN CREATION OF DATA FILES TO BE PLACED IN THE POSTGRES DATABASE.
THESE FORMULAS FOLLOW THE PROTOCOL USED TO PRE-PROCESS DATA FROM OUR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS SYSTEM 
USING A COMBINATION OF TABLE EXTRACTION USING SQL AND THEN USING POWER BI/DAX/M-CODE TO READY DATA FOR PYTHON PANDAS AND ML ANALYSIS.



MaxDXDate = CALCULATE(
    max(diagnosis[date_of_diagnosis]),
    ALLEXCEPT(diagnosis,diagnosis[PATID]))
	
	
IsMaxDXDate = if(diagnosis[date_of_diagnosis] = diagnosis[MaxDXDate], "MostRecent", "Previous")


Sample code to rank by date for duplicate initial CANS when there is more than one tx episode:

MAXEpisode = CALCULATE(
    max(shortcans[EPISODE_NUMBER]),
    ALLEXCEPT(shortcans,shortcans[PATID]))
IsMaxEpisode = IF(shortcans[EPISODE_NUMBER] =shortcans[MAXEpisode], "MostRecent", "Previous")


DAX code to ensure we are able to filter on the most recent date of discharge and thus the most recent episode

MaxDCDate = CALCULATE(
    max('discharge'[date_of_discharge]),
    ALLEXCEPT(discharge,discharge[PATID]))

ISMaxDate = IF(discharge[date_of_discharge]= discharge[MaxDCDate], "MostRecent", "Previous")


Code to define successful discharge as the combination of achieved goals and transitioning down to a lower level of care:

Successful DC = if(discharge[Clinical_Change_Needs_Value.2] = "Needs Lower Level of Care", "Successful", [Reason_Value])
